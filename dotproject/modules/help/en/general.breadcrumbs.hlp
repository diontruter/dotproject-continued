<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>Breadcrumbs are the links under the title of a page (they are usually separated by a colon : ).</p>
<p>The breadcrumbs provide you a convenient method of forward and backward navigation within a module just like in the fairy tale "Hänsel und Gretel" where the children used breadcrumbs to mark the way back to their home.</p>
