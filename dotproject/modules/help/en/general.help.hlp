<h1>Getting Help</h1>

<p>There is a small help icon on each page, usually to the far right of the page title, that will open the <b>Help Documentation</b> main index page. You can then navigate to various help documents from this table of contents.</p>

<p>You can also access the <b>Help Documentation</b> by clicking the <b>help</b> link in the navigation menu.</p>

<p>Our help documentation is found in the <code>/modules/help</code> directory. Each individual help file is simply a HTML test file with a <code>.hlp</code> file extension. If you want to customize your help documentation, or create new help documentation, just use one of the existing documentation files as a template.</p>
