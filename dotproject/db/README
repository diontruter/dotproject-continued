Notes to developers and users:

dotproject.sql is the full installation script for the latest CVS version.

upgrade_latest.sql is the differences between the last release version and
the current CVS version.  It will be renamed once a release is created.

Developers:  Please make sure you add your changes to both these files.
Do not add changes to version specific upgrade files.

Users:  For new installations use dotproject.sql.  For a release upgrade
use the relevent upgrade_xxx_to_yyy.sql script.  If you want to upgrade
to the current CVS version you will need to use upgrade_latest.sql but
be aware that this file is changing and will not be found in a release
version.
