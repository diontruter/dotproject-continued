*** dotProject CHANGES as of 08 July 2002

*/

This code begins with dotproject-0.2.1 and has Nicola Fankhauser's (nikee)
pain-relieving patch for 0.2.1 applied before making additional modifications.

The code was then modified by Adam Donnison and released as dotproject-ajd.0215.

The /includes/gateway.pl and ticketsmith module files of Jim Flowers from
dotproject-jbf-0213 were then incorporated. These changes included using a
variable $app_root to remove some hardcoding of links from gateway.pl.

The database logic changes of Leo West from module dotproject-leo.0214 
were then added.  These database upgrades were further modified by John Pritchard (JRP). Changes and additions to Leo West's modifications include:
// Consistent Field Naming
1) RENAME contacts.icon -> contacts.contact_icon, events.icon -> events.event_icon, files.icon -> files.file_icon
// Consistent VarChar Attributes
2) CHANGE contacts.contact_company varchar(30) to varchar(100)
// Increase size of contact_title field further
3) CHANGE contacts.contact_title varchar(30) to varchar(50)

Other Minor Modifications by John Pritchard include:
Update install documentation, remove extraneous files (e.g. /docs/dotproject.sql, *.php.orig, etc), modify /style/main.css so 
that button descriptions fit, review and integrate other Leo 
West files.

Other files added from Leo West (dotproject-leo.0214) include:
/functions/*, miscellaneous /images/ files, /images/obj/ folder 
and graphics, /locales/ folder, subfolder and files. 

JRP also added Axel Napolitano's "Documentation of dotproject's plug-in interface" as /docs/MODULES.txt.
