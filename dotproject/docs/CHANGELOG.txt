11 August 2002 (AJE):
-----------------------------
This update includes a reqork of the security model. Security is loaded once in
includes/permissions.php rather than also in any subsequent module. This
provides a much more portable method of determining module level permissions
and cut down on multiple calls to the permissions table.
Companies and Contacts have been included as test modules in this update. Other
modules will be included when thoroughly tested.
Caveat: this method does not check for the case of deny-all as this is the
assumed default condition.
