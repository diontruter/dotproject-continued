Installing dotproject- hopefully an easy process

This document assumes that you have a working web server 
running apache+php+MYSQL and access to a MySQL database.

1) 	Download the dotproject tarball from www.dotmarketing.org:
		http://www.dotmarketing.org/dotproject/dotproject_02.tar.gz
	
2) 	Unpack the tarball in your web root directory:
		tar -zxvf dotproject_02.tar.gz
	
3) 	Create a new mysql database called dotproject, create a 
		new user called dotproject and grant access to user dotproject 
		on the new dotproject database.
	
		mysql> CREATE database dotproject;
		mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dotproject.* TO dotproject@'localhost' IDENTIFIED 
			BY 'yourpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	
4) 	Slurp up the db schema and check your permissions at the same time: 
		mysql -udotproject -pyourpassword dotproject < dotproject/db/dotproject.sql 

	
5) 	Edit the config file dotproject/includes/config.php and 
		make the appropiate changes to db host, name, username, 
		password and web root directory

6) 	Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/dotproject/index.php.  If 
		all is well, you should see a login page. 
		Username: admin
		Password: passwd
		
7)		Click on the Users button and change the admin password as soon as possible.

8) 	Have fun and send us the bug fixes!

Web trouble ticket email gateway: dotproject/includes/gateway.pl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(from the ticketsmith installation)

1.	Have a working perl install, with DBI and the DBD::MySQL bundles installed
2.  Be sure to protect the gateway.pl file.  You basically need to do one 
    of two things, either move it out of a web-accessible place or somehow 
    protect it from being accessed over the web:
    
            <Files "gateway.pl">
                    order deny,allow
                    deny from all
            </Files>
    
    If you don't protect it, one of two things will happen,  either users will be
    able to see the source and thus grab your Ticketsmith MySQL password, or
    something unpredictable will happen when Apache tries  to run it as a CGI
    script.  I don't think this could be harmful, but hey,  you never know.



7.  Edit the top of gateway.pl to fit your setup.


    
9.  Configure your MDA or MTA to pipe mail for your support list to gateway.pl.  For
    example,  here is a sample procmail recipe:

            :0
            * (^To:|^CC:|^Cc:) .*support@foo.bar
            |/path/to/gateway.pl

    You can also set Ticketsmith up directly with sendmail in /etc/aliases: 

            support: "|/path/to/gateway.pl"

    Keep in mind that with sendmail you need to either put gateway.pl in 
    /etc/smrsh or at least symlink to it from that directory so that 
    sendmail will execute it.  If you do this, you'll have to point 
    the /etc/aliases entry to the copy in /etc/smrsh.
