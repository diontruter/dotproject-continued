<h1>Upgrading dotProject</h1>

<h2>Upgrading an Existing Version</h2>
<p>Here is a general outline of how to upgrade your existing version of dotProject (probably version 0.2.1 or 0.2.2)<p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest release and follow the install instructions placing it in a new directory.</li>
	<li>Create a copy of your existing dotProject database.</li>
	<li>Edit the database parameters in the config.php file to point to this copied db.</li>
	<li>Apply the upgrade script to the copied db.</li>
	<li>Test out the new version of dotProject.  If all is well then promote this version to production and archive your old data (just in case).  If there is a problem then let up know.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Upgrading to Version 1.0</h3>
Version 1.0 incorporates many additions and modifications to existing database structure.&nbsp; You need to apply the script upgrade_022_to_100.sql to your MySQL database to upgrade from wither version 0.2.1 or 0.2.2.<br />
<br />

<h3>Upgrading DotProject 1.0 alpha 1 to DotProject 1.0 alpha 2</h3>
The task_log, tasks and projects tables have all changed slightly from alpha 1 to alpha 2. You will need to upgrade your database to take advantage of these improvements.<br />
<br />
Apply the <code>upgrade_alpha2_to_beta1.sql</code> script to your database copy.<br />
<br />
The example below assumes the following configuration. Please modify the example commands to match your local settings. These commands are executed from the commandline within the dotproject database directory.<br />
<br />
<pre>
	$dPconfig['dbname'] = "dp_1_0_alpha";
	$dPconfig['dbuser'] = "dp_user";
	$dPconfig['dbpass'] = "dp_pass";
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Upgrading DotProject 1.0 alpha 2 to DotProject 1.0 beta 1</h3>
Beta 1 includes two major security improvements.  Changes were made to prevent a vulnerability caused by malicious injection of SQL into the username and password fields.  The password encryption method was also changed in line with recommendations from MySQL.<br />
<br />
Apply the <code>upgrade_alpha2_to_beta1.sql</code> script to your database copy.<br />
<br />
There is a configuration variable, <code>check_legacy_password</code>, that also needs to be set to <code>true</code>.
<pre>$dPconfig['check_legacy_password'] = true;</pre>
This will capture a password verified under the old encyption scheme and upgrade on the first successful login of the user.<br/>
<br />
<br />

<strong>Backup Existing Database</strong><br />
<emphasis>mysqldump -udp_user -pdp_pass dp_1_0_alpha > dp_1_0_alpha1_backup.sql</emphasis><br />
<br />

<strong>Upgrade the Database</strong><br />
<emphasis>mysql -udp_user -pdp_pass dp_1_0_alpha < upgrade_100_alpha1_to_alpha2.sql</emphasis><br />
<emphasis>mysql -udp_user -pdp_pass dp_1_0_alpha < upgrade_100_alpha2_to_beta1.sql</emphasis><br />
<br />
A new <code>temp</code> directory can be found under the <code>files/</code> directory.  This is used for the generation of temporary files (for example, PDF reports).  This directory will need to have permissions to make it writable from the web server.
<br />

<h3>Upgrading Beyond version 1.0.0</h3>
All upgrades beyond version 1.0.0 follow the same policy.<br />

Backup the database, then apply the appropriate upgrade_{from_version}_to_{to_version}.sql scripts.  As an example, to upgrade from 1.0 to 1.0.2 you will need to apply <b>both</b> upgrade_100_to_101.sql and upgrade_101_to_102.sql.
