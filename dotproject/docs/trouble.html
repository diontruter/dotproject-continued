<h1>Trouble shooting dotProject</h1>

<h2>config.php settings</h2>
<ol>
	<li>On a new installation, have you created a copy of the distribution file called <b>config-dist.php</b> called <b>config.php</b>?</li>
	
	<li>When upgrading an existing installation, have you checked that any new configuration settings in <b>config-dist.php</b> have been transferred to <b>config.php</b>?</li>
	
	<li>Is the <b>root_dir</b> variable set correctly.</li>
	
	<li>Is there any white space (including carriage returns) after the closing php brace ?&gt;.  If so, delete them.  This cause the html headers to be sent too early.</li>

	<li>When upgrading, have you set the configuration variable <code>check_legacy_password</code> to <code>true</code>.
	<pre>$dPconfig['check_legacy_password'] = true;</pre>
	</li>
</ol>


<h2>php.ini file settings</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>register_globals = off</b>
		<br />Set to off, this hould generally work satisfactorily but you could try setting it to on.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>session.auto_start = 0</b>
		<br />This may generally be set to zero.  If you are experiencing trouble and this variable is set to 1, try setting it to 0.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>session.save_path = /tmp</b> (*nix style)
		<br /><b>session.save_path = "d:/apache/php/sessiontemp"</b> (Windows style)
		<br />Check that this directory actually exists.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>PHP</h2>
<ol>
	<li>You need PHP version 4.1.x or higher.</li>
	<li>Is <b>MySQL</b> correctly compiled with PHP on a *nix server.  You can check this by writing a simple little php file that simply contains:
	<pre>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</pre>
	Point your browser at this file (via your web server!) and see if there are configuration entries for MySQL.
	</li>

	<li>If the Gantt charts aren't working, have you compiled the GD libraries with PHP?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Help!</h2>
<p>If all else fails then post your problem on the SourceForge forum or Tracker.  However, to help out we remote developers, please include the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your PHP and MySQL version.</li>
	<li>Your web server and it's version.</li>
	<li>Your browser and version is useful.</li>
	<li>The version of dotProject you are using (file release or CVS).</li>
</ul>
