stable-2
========

Stable 2 is the current development tree of dotProject.  At the moment
it is mostly in maintenance mode, with only occasional new features
as requested by heavy users.

dotProject is an open source project management system written in PHP.

Additional fixes
================

Note: This (Git) repo was migrated from SVN to Git and contains much
needed fixes not in the original SVN repo. This started with the
feature/php71-fixes branch that was just concerned with getting the
code working with PHP 7.1. The PHP fixes have now been pushed to the
develop branch, and further bug fixes will henceforth be pushed to
develop as they are made.
